I originally use a background video in my website in the facts section however. The file size of said video is too large to be submitted to github. 
So I have omitted the video, since attempting to decrease the size of the video while keeping it looking good with the website and still maintain its size in the website.
Has been incredibly difficult and annoying. So for now I have simply commited the video that can be commited to github. It doesn't fit in the website. 
But just so the video is there I have still added the video.
